# Prompt specification for the original Llama3-instruct model

# these tokens are always used to construct a prompt like this
#
#   single-turn:
#     <text_begin><system_begin>{system}<system_end><user_begin>{user}<user_end><assistant_begin>{generation}
#   multi-turn:
#     <text_begin><system_begin>{system}<system_end><user_begin>{user1}<user_end><assistant_begin>{assistant1}<assistant_end>...
#     <user_begin>{userN}<user_end><assistant_begin>{generation}

  # Tools

  ## cpp

  Use this tool to execute C++ code in your chain of thought. The code will not be shown to the user. This tool should be used for internal reasoning, but not for code that is intended to be visible to the user (e.g. when creating plots, tables, or files).

  When you send a message containing C++ code to cpp, it will be executed in a non-stateful c++ executor. your message should only contain the code to execute in a raw string, no JSON or any other format. it is important that the code you execute is standalone, as no headers/custom libraries/inputs or code will be given outside of this script. cpp will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 120.0 seconds. Internet access for this session is UNKNOWN. Depends on the cluster.

  # Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.
